# Currency Converter Project
The Currency Converter Project is designed to be a practical application leveraging the Python programming language to create a tool that allows users to convert amounts between different currencies. This project utilizes the ExchangeRate-API for fetching real-time exchange rate data and provides an interface for users to specify the amount in one currency and get the equivalent amount in another currency. Additionally, the project features a user-friendly UI using Streamlit, making it accessible for non-technical users to perform currency conversions with ease.

A solution within this project is expected to deliver the following outcomes:

Currency Exchange Rate Retrieval: Users should be able to input two currencies (e.g., USD and EUR) and retrieve the current exchange rate between them using the ExchangeRate-API.
Currency Conversion: Given an amount in one currency, users should be able to convert it to the equivalent amount in another currency. The program will apply the latest exchange rates to perform this calculation.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): A Streamlit-based GUI that allows users to perform the above operations through a web interface. The GUI should be intuitive and user-friendly, enabling users with no technical background to use the application with ease.
## Learning Outcome
By completing this project, learners will be able to:

- Understand and implement REST API calls in Python to fetch data from an external service.
- Parse and handle JSON data in Python.
- Perform currency conversion calculations using real-time exchange rates.
- Develop a basic UI using Streamlit to interact with Python scripts.
- Organize a Python project with multiple solutions and manage dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
- Apply best practices for writing readable and maintainable Python code.
